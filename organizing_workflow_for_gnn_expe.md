Ok. I am working in my master thesis developing the idea of modeling relational databases as homogeneous graph for further processing with GNNs. So for example, If I have a RDB with amazon books purchases I might define the task of predicting whether some customers will churn in the next three months for a given date... Then the idea will be to create a graph whose nodes are customers (the entity we are trying to classify) and the main idea is how to create the edges between the customers? Given all the information available in the RDB, how you could create the most informative edges between the nodes for a GNN to classify them???

The idea then is to do a bunch of experiments to try to find some results!! Take for example the notebook I have created where the edges between the customers are created if they share some common categories in the past purchases they have done...

Now... I am feeling a bit stagnated with my current workflow... I have worked mostly with jupyter notebooks and the project is getting complex enough so I think there may be a better a more efficient ways to run my tests.

In essence I would like to test many things:
	- Differents RDB datasets.
	- Different graphs or way of processing the same dataset (maybe creating a heterogeneous graph or a MLP to see different results, and of course many different way of constructing the homogeneous graph)
	- Visualizing and analyzing the graphs created
	- Different models for the same graphs (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GIN)
	- Analyzing the results (confusion matrix, classification reports etc)
	
What is the way to organize my workflow in different scripts, notebooks etc?? I am not very used to work in code projects so It would be helpful If dont assume a big previous experience and please explain things from the ground up.

Of course! It's great that you're thinking about structuring your project more systematically. This is a common challenge when research projects grow, and moving from a purely notebook-based workflow to a more organized project structure will make your experimentation much more efficient, reproducible, and scalable. Your master's thesis will benefit greatly from this.

The core idea is to separate the different logical parts of your project (data processing, model training, analysis) into different files and directories. This is a standard practice in software development and data science. You already have a great starting point with the `TFM_Project` directory structure. Let's build on that.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can organize your workflow, using your current notebook as an example.

### 1. The Project Structure

Let's refine the `TFM_Project` structure. This structure separates concerns, making it easy to find code, data, and results.

```
TFM_Project/
├── data/
│   ├── 1_raw/
│   │   └── rel-amazon/          # Raw data, never modified
│   ├── 2_intermediate/
│   │   └── rel-amazon/          # Processed data, e.g., filtered tables
│   └── 3_processed/
│       └── rel-amazon/          # Final data for modeling, e.g., graph objects
│
├── notebooks/
│   ├── 1_data_exploration.ipynb   # For initial exploration
│   └── 2_results_analysis.ipynb   # For analyzing experiment results
│
├── reports/
│   └── figures/                 # For generated plots, like confusion matrices
│
├── src/
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── process_data.py        # Scripts to process raw data to intermediate data
│   ├── features/
│   │   └── build_graph.py         # Scripts to build graphs from intermediate data
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── gcn.py                 # GCN model definition
│   │   ├── gat.py                 # GAT model definition
│   │   ├── train_evaluate.py      # Training and evaluation logic
│   └── visualization/
│       └── plot.py                # Helper functions for plotting
│
└── run_experiment.py                # A single script to run an entire experiment
```

### 2. Refactoring Your Jupyter Notebook

Your notebook `v3_filter_amazon_db.ipynb` does everything in one place: data loading, preprocessing, graph creation, model training, and evaluation. Let's break it down into modules that fit into our new structure.

#### **Step 2.1: Data Processing**

The first part of your notebook loads parquet files, joins them, and creates an `expanded_train.csv`. This is "data processing". This logic should be a reusable script.

*   **Action:** Create a file `src/data/process_data.py`. This script will take raw data paths as input and write the intermediate CSVs to `data/2_intermediate/`.

Your code from cells `cc3b7d3d` to `b3bec663` would be adapted into a function in this file.

#### **Step 2.2: Graph Construction (Feature Engineering)**

The next part of your notebook builds the graph: it processes categories, builds an inverted index, and creates the `edge_index`. This is a "feature engineering" step where you create the graph structure.

*   **Action:** Create a file `src/features/build_graph.py`. This script will take the intermediate data (e.g., `expanded_train.csv`) and the product category data as input, and it will save a PyTorch Geometric `Data` object to `data/3_processed/`.

The logic from cells `60cdaa97` through `1d7c8a3c` in your notebook would go here. You can make the edge creation logic a function. This way, you can easily add *new* functions for different edge creation strategies (e.g., based on co-purchase, creating heterogeneous graphs, etc.).

For example, in `src/features/build_graph.py`:

```python
import pandas as pd
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data
# ... other imports

def create_edges_shared_categories(df, threshold=1):
    # Your logic for creating edges based on shared categories
    # ...
    return edge_index

def build_graph(intermediate_data_path, processed_data_path):
    train_df = pd.read_csv(intermediate_data_path)
    
    # --- Graph construction logic ---
    edge_index = create_edges_shared_categories(train_df)
    
    # --- Node feature creation ---
    # ... your logic for creating 'x'
    
    # --- Labels ---
    y = torch.tensor(train_df['churn'].values, dtype=torch.long)
    
    data = Data(x=x, edge_index=edge_index, y=y)
    torch.save(data, processed_data_path)

```

#### **Step 2.3: Model Definition**

You define a `BaselineGCN` model. Each model architecture should live in its own file.

*   **Action:** Create `src/models/gcn.py` and put your `BaselineGCN` class definition there. If you want to test a GAT, you would create `src/models/gat.py` with a `GATModel` class. This makes your models modular.

`src/models/gcn.py`:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class BaselineGCN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_channels, out_channels):
        super(BaselineGCN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(in_channels, hidden_channels)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_channels, hidden_channels*2)
        self.conv3 = GCNConv(hidden_channels*2, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # ... forward pass logic
        return x
```

#### **Step 2.4: Training and Evaluation**

Your notebook has functions for training and testing (`train_loop`, `test`, `train_and_evaluate`). This logic is central to all your experiments.

*   **Action:** Move these functions into `src/models/train_evaluate.py`. This script will handle the training loop, validation, testing, and saving results.

#### **Step 2.5: Visualization and Analysis**

The last part of your notebook generates a classification report and a confusion matrix. This is analysis and visualization. **Notebooks are excellent for this!**

*   **Action:** Keep this logic in a notebook inside the `notebooks/` directory, for example, `notebooks/2_results_analysis.ipynb`. This notebook would load the *saved results* from an experiment and visualize them. It won't run the training itself.

### 3. Running Experiments Systematically

Now that the code is modularized, how do you run an experiment? Instead of running cells in a notebook, you'll run a single script that orchestrates everything. This is where `run_experiment.py` in the root of your project comes in.

This script will be the entry point for all your experiments. You can use command-line arguments to control what it does. A library like `argparse` is standard for this.

Here’s a simplified example of what `run_experiment.py` might look like:

```python
import argparse
import torch
from src.features.build_graph import build_graph
from src.models.gcn import BaselineGCN # or import GAT, etc.
from src.models.train_evaluate import train_and_evaluate
import os

def main(args):
    # 1. Build graph if it doesn't exist
    if not os.path.exists(args.processed_data_path):
        print("Building graph...")
        # This would call the data processing script first if needed
        build_graph(args.intermediate_data_path, args.processed_data_path)
    
    data = torch.load(args.processed_data_path)

    # 2. Initialize model based on arguments
    if args.model == 'gcn':
        model = BaselineGCN(in_channels=data.num_node_features, 
                            hidden_channels=args.hidden_channels, 
                            out_channels=1)
    # add elif for 'gat', 'graphsage', etc.

    # 3. Train and evaluate
    print(f"Training {args.model} model...")
    results = train_and_evaluate(model, data)
    
    print("Results:", results)
    # Here you would save the results, model, plots etc. to a unique directory.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Run GNN Experiment')
    
    # Arguments for data, model, training etc.
    parser.add_argument('--model', type=str, default='gcn', help='GNN model to use (gcn, gat, etc.)')
    parser.add_argument('--dataset', type=str, default='rel-amazon', help='Dataset to use')
    # ... other arguments like learning rate, hidden channels etc.
    
    # You would construct paths based on dataset name
    args = parser.parse_args()
    args.intermediate_data_path = f'data/2_intermediate/{args.dataset}/expanded_train.csv'
    args.processed_data_path = f'data/3_processed/{args.dataset}/graph.pt'

    main(args)
```

You would run this from your terminal:

```bash
python run_experiment.py --model gcn --hidden_channels 128
python run_experiment.py --model gat --hidden_channels 64
```

This workflow makes it incredibly easy to test your ideas:
*   **Test a new model?** Add a model file in `src/models`, add an `elif` in `run_experiment.py`, and run it with `--model new_model`.
*   **Test a new graph construction?** Add a function in `src/features/build_graph.py` and add an argument to `run_experiment.py` to select it.
*   **Test on a new dataset?** Put the data in `data/1_raw` and add logic to handle it in your processing scripts, then run with `--dataset new_dataset`.

### Summary of the New Workflow

1.  **Explore Data:** Use a notebook in `notebooks/` to play with the raw data and understand it.
2.  **Develop Code:** Write your data processing, graph building, and model code in the `src/` directory as Python modules (`.py` files).
3.  **Run Experiments:** Execute `run_experiment.py` from your terminal with different arguments to test different hypotheses. The script saves the models and results.
4.  **Analyze Results:** Use another notebook in `notebooks/` to load the saved results from multiple experiments, compare them, and create final plots for your thesis.

This structured approach might seem like more work upfront, but it will save you a massive amount of time in the long run. It makes your research more organized, reproducible, and professional.

I can help you create these files and move the code from your notebook if you'd like to start. Just let me know what your first step should be!

perfect!! 

Now I would like you to help me in something else for this... I would like to take advantage of the GPU resources given by Kaggle!! even to perform some data analysis and things like that because the RAM resources of the machines they offer are better than mine...

Is there a good workflow you could recommend me? To maybe alternate between my personal laptop, Kaggle? Maybe using Github and Git to have the code synced im not sure?? I am also not very savvy with git/github so I am not sure if that would be helpful!!

In essence, I would like to take advantage of the resouces offered by the Kaggle platform, so Id like to know what is the best and most efficient and clean way to integrate that into my workflow of the project

---

**Cursor**

Excellent question! Integrating cloud computing resources like Kaggle into your local workflow is a key skill for any data scientist. It allows you to write and debug code on your laptop with small data samples, and then scale up to powerful machines for the heavy lifting, like training models or processing large datasets.

You are absolutely right: **Git and GitHub are the perfect tools for this.** Don't worry about not being savvy with them; the workflow for this specific purpose is quite simple and repetitive. I'll walk you through it from the ground up.

### The Core Idea: Separating Development from Execution

Think of it this way:

*   **Your Laptop is your "Development Studio":** This is where you write your Python scripts (`.py` files), experiment in notebooks with small data subsets, and organize your project. It's for tasks that don't require a lot of RAM or a GPU.
*   **Kaggle is your "Factory":** This is where you run the heavy, time-consuming computations. You send your finished code there to run on their powerful machines with the full dataset.
*   **GitHub is the "Transport System":** It's the central place where you store your code, allowing you to easily move it from your "Studio" (laptop) to your "Factory" (Kaggle).

### The Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here is the most efficient and clean way to set this up.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Repository

This will be the single source of truth for your code.

1.  **Create a GitHub Account:** If you don't have one, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).
2.  **Create a New Repository:** On your GitHub page, create a new repository. Let's call it `master-thesis-gnn`. **Crucially, make it a "Private" repository.** Your thesis code is your intellectual property, so you don't want it to be public.
3.  **Clone the Repository to Your Laptop:** On your computer, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to where you want to store your projects (e.g., `C:\Users\Luis\Desktop\Master\`), and run the `git clone` command that GitHub provides. It will look something like this:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/master-thesis-gnn.git
    ```
    This creates a new folder named `master-thesis-gnn` on your laptop that is linked to your online GitHub repository.
4.  **Move Your Project In:** Move your `TFM_Project` folder and all its contents inside this new `master-thesis-gnn` folder.

#### Step 2: The Local Git Workflow (It's simple!)

Now, you'll make changes locally. When you're happy with them, you "push" them to GitHub. This cycle has three simple commands.

1.  **Add Changes:** After you've edited or created files, you tell Git to track these changes.
    ```bash
    # From inside the 'master-thesis-gnn' folder
    git add .
    ```
    (The `.` means "add everything in this directory and subdirectories").

2.  **Commit Changes:** You save a snapshot of your changes with a descriptive message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add GAT model and update training script"
    ```

3.  **Push Changes:** You upload your saved snapshot to your GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
That's it! You just repeat this `add -> commit -> push` cycle whenever you've made significant progress on your laptop.

#### Step 3: Integrating Kaggle Notebooks

This is where the magic happens. You'll use a Kaggle Notebook to pull your code from GitHub and run it.

1.  **Handling Your Data:** **Do NOT upload data to GitHub.** Git is for code, not large datasets. Instead, create a **Kaggle Dataset**.
    *   Go to Kaggle, click "Create" -> "New Dataset".
    *   Upload your `rel-amazon` dataset files.
    *   You can make this dataset **private** so only you can see and use it.
    *   When you use this dataset in a Kaggle Notebook, it will be available at the path `/kaggle/input/your-dataset-name/`.

2.  **Handling Your Code in a Kaggle Notebook:**
    *   Create a new Kaggle Notebook.
    *   In the notebook settings (on the right panel), go to "Internet" and turn it **On**.
    *   The very first cell of your notebook will be used to clone your GitHub repository. Since your repo is private, you need to use a "Personal Access Token" instead of your password.
        *   **Create a Token:** In GitHub, go to Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal access tokens -> Generate new token. Give it a name, set an expiration, and check the `repo` scope. Copy the token (it looks like `ghp_...`).
    *   Now, clone your repo in the first cell of your Kaggle notebook:
        ```python
        # The '!' runs a shell command
        # Replace 'your-username' and 'ghp_YourToken'
        !git clone https://your-username:ghp_YourToken@github.com/your-username/master-thesis-gnn.git
        ```
    This will download your entire project structure into the Kaggle Notebook's environment.

3.  **Running Your Experiment:**
    *   Now, you can run your experiment script from a notebook cell, passing the correct paths for the Kaggle environment.
        ```python
        # This runs your main script
        !python master-thesis-gnn/TFM_Project/run_experiment.py \
            --model gcn \
            --dataset rel-amazon \
            --data_path /kaggle/input/your-dataset-name/ \
            --output_path /kaggle/working/
        ```
    *   Your script will save its output (models, results, figures) to `/kaggle/working/`. This is the notebook's output directory. When you "Save Version" of the notebook, everything in `/kaggle/working/` will be saved as the notebook's output. You can then download these files to your local machine for analysis.

### The Complete Workflow Loop

Here is your new, efficient workflow:

1.  **On your Laptop:**
    *   Edit your code in `src/`. For example, create a new model `src/models/gat.py`.
    *   Test it with a tiny fraction of your data to make sure it runs without errors.
    *   Once you're ready, push your changes to GitHub: `git add .`, `git commit -m "..."`, `git push`.

2.  **On Kaggle:**
    *   Open your Kaggle Notebook.
    *   Add your private Kaggle Dataset.
    *   Run the first cell to `git clone` your latest code.
    *   Run the experiment cell (`!python run_experiment.py ...`).
    *   Let it run. You can even close your browser. Kaggle will finish the computation.
    *   When it's done, go to the notebook's "Viewer" page, find the "Output" section, and download your results (e.g., `results.csv`, `confusion_matrix.png`, `best_model.pt`).

3.  **On your Laptop again:**
    *   Analyze the downloaded results in your `notebooks/2_results_analysis.ipynb`.
    *   Based on the results, decide what to try next, and go back to step 1.

This workflow keeps your project clean, makes your experiments reproducible, and lets you leverage powerful hardware for free, all while maintaining a single, synchronized codebase.

To get started, I can help you create a `.gitignore` file for your project. This is an important file that tells Git which files and folders (like data folders or Python cache) to ignore, keeping your repository clean. Would you like me to do that?

```shellscript
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/master-thesis-gnn.git
```

```shellscript
    # From inside the 'master-thesis-gnn' folder
    git add .
```

```shellscript
    git commit -m "Add GAT model and update training script"
```

```shellscript
    git push
```

```python
        # The '!' runs a shell command
        # Replace 'your-username' and 'ghp_YourToken'
        !git clone https://your-username:ghp_YourToken@github.com/your-username/master-thesis-gnn.git
```

```python
        # This runs your main script
        !python master-thesis-gnn/TFM_Project/run_experiment.py \
            --model gcn \
            --dataset rel-amazon \
            --data_path /kaggle/input/your-dataset-name/ \
            --output_path /kaggle/working/
```

For example the process_data.py script, is this suppose to be a single script parametrized for all the preprocessing I need to do? For different datasets or purposes? Or should I have different scripts for different purposes?? What is the idea here?

---

**Cursor**

That's an excellent and very important question. It gets to the heart of creating a reusable and scalable research codebase.

The short answer is: **You should aim for a single, parameterized script for a single, well-defined processing *pipeline*.** If you have a fundamentally different way of processing data, you would create a different script.

Let's break down what that means.

### The Philosophy: One Script per "Recipe"

Think of your data processing scripts like recipes in a cookbook.

*   You have a recipe for "Amazon Customer Churn Prediction Data". This recipe involves loading `customer`, `product`, and `review` tables, joining them in a specific way, filtering by a time window, and saving the result.
*   This single recipe (`process_data.py`) can be tweaked with **parameters**:
    *   You can use different **ingredients** (different datasets like `rel-amazon-uk` or `rel-amazon-de`).
    *   You can change the **cooking time** (a 6-month window vs. a 12-month window).
    *   You can change the **serving size** (processing the first 1000 rows for a test vs. the full dataset).

However, if you want to make a completely different dish, like "Product Recommendation Data", which might involve creating user-item interaction pairs instead of user-churn labels, that's a *fundamentally different recipe*. For that, you would create a new script, maybe `process_data_for_recommendations.py`.

### When to Parameterize vs. When to Create a New Script

Here’s a simple rule of thumb:

| Use a Parameter (in the *same* script) if you are changing... | Create a New Script if you are changing...                                                                                               |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The **input/output file paths** (i.e., using a different dataset like F1 vs. Amazon). | The **fundamental logic or purpose** of the processing (e.g., preparing data for churn vs. for link prediction).           |
| A **hyperparameter** of the processing (e.g., the `-6mo` time window, a minimum review count). | The **core set of tables and joins** being used (e.g., a new dataset has `users`, `posts`, `likes` instead of customers and reviews). |
| The **amount of data** being processed (e.g., a `--debug` flag to only process 1000 rows). | The **final schema or structure** of the output table. If the columns being created are completely different, it's a new task.     |

### Let's Make it Concrete: Your `process_data.py`

Looking at your `v3_filter_amazon_db.ipynb`, your "recipe" is to create an `expanded_train` table for the churn prediction task. Let's design `src/data/process_data.py` for this specific pipeline.

It should take command-line arguments for the things that might change between experiments. Here's how you could structure it:

I will create the `src/data/process_data.py` file for you with a solid, parameterized structure.

Okay, I will create the `src/data/process_data.py` script for you. This script will encapsulate the data processing logic from your notebook and make it reusable. I'll use `argparse` to handle command-line arguments for input/output paths and other parameters.

That's an excellent and very important question. It gets to the heart of creating a reusable and scalable project.

The "golden rule" is this: **Aim for one script per logical *processing pipeline*, and use parameters to handle variations within that pipeline.**

Let's break down what that means for your project.

### 1. What is a "Processing Pipeline"?

In your case, the pipeline you've developed in your notebook is:
1.  Load the `customer`, `review`, and `product` parquet files.
2.  Load the `train`, `test`, and `val` task files.
3.  Join the `train` data with `review` data based on `customer_id`.
4.  Group by the original training columns and aggregate the `product_id`s that were purchased in the 6 months prior to the `timestamp`.
5.  Save this new, enriched dataframe (`expanded_train.csv`) to an intermediate location.

This entire sequence is a single, logical pipeline for preparing the data for your **churn prediction task on the Amazon dataset**.

### 2. When to Parameterize (Use one script)

You should use a **single `process_data.py` script** for all variations that still follow this same basic pipeline. You just change the "settings" or "knobs" of the pipeline.

**You should parameterize for:**

*   **Different Datasets:** Your script should not have hardcoded paths. You should pass the *input directory* and *output directory* as arguments. This way, you can easily point it at `rel-amazon`, `rel-f1`, or any other dataset that has the same table structure.
*   **Pipeline Hyperparameters:** Your notebook hardcodes a 6-month look-back window (`.dt.offset_by('-6mo')`). What if you want to test a 3-month or 12-month window? This is a perfect candidate for a parameter.
*   **Different Entities:** What if you want to predict product churn instead of customer churn? The core logic of loading and joining might be the same, but the grouping entity changes. This could also be a parameter.

### 3. When to Create a New Script

You should create a **new, separate script** when the fundamental processing logic changes entirely.

**Create a new script for:**

*   **A Completely Different Task:** Let's say you want to use the same Amazon data for a *product recommendation* task. Your output would no longer be a dataframe of `(customer_id, churn_label, features)`, but maybe `(customer_id, recommended_product_id)`. The joins, aggregations, and logic would be so different that it warrants a new script, maybe named `process_data_for_recommendations.py`.
*   **A Fundamentally Different Data Source:** If you download a new dataset that isn't a relational database (e.g., a collection of text files, a pre-made graph dataset), the entire concept of "loading parquets and joining them" doesn't apply. This would need its own script.

### Concrete Example: Your `process_data.py`

Let's make this real. Here is how you could structure `src/data/process_data.py` based on your notebook, making it a reusable, parameterized script.

I will create this file for you. It will contain the logic from your notebook, but wrapped in functions and controlled by command-line arguments using Python's standard `argparse` library.

Okay, I will create the `src/data/process_data.py` file with the refactored, parameterized code. I'll also create a `.gitignore` file, which is a crucial part of using Git, to tell it which files (like data and cache files) to ignore.

First, I will list the contents of the `TFM_Project` directory to see its current state.

Perfect. Now I'll create the `.gitignore` file in the root of your `TFM_Project`. This will prevent large data files, Python cache, and other temporary files from being accidentally added to your GitHub repository. This is a very important step for keeping your repository clean and manageable.

My apologies, it seems I can't create new files directly. I'll provide you with the content for the `.gitignore` file, and you can create it yourself.

Please create a file named `.gitignore` in the `TFM_Project/` directory and add the following content to it. It's a plain text file.

**`.gitignore`:**
```
# Ignore datasets - This is the most important rule!
data/1_raw/
data/2_intermediate/
data/3_processed/

# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Environments
.env
venv/
env/
```
This file will tell Git to ignore all the raw, intermediate, and processed data, which should never be committed to a repository.

Now, let's update `src/data/process_data.py`. I will replace the placeholder content with a fully functional, parameterized script based on the logic from your notebook. This will allow you to run your data processing from the command line for different datasets and settings.

```plaintext
# Ignore datasets - This is the most important rule!
data/1_raw/
data/2_intermediate/
data/3_processed/

# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Environments
.env
venv/
env/
```

I apologize again. It seems I'm having trouble with file modification tools.

Let's proceed by having you update the file. Please **replace the entire content** of `TFM_Project/src/data/process_data.py` with the following code. This new script is modular and controlled by command-line arguments, which is exactly what you need for a robust experimental workflow.

**`TFM_Project/src/data/process_data.py`:**

### How to Use This New Script

Now, from your terminal, inside the `TFM_Project` folder, you can run:

```bash
# Process the amazon dataset with the default 6-month window
python src/data/process_data.py --dataset rel-amazon

# Process the amazon dataset with a 1-year window
python src/data/process_data.py --dataset rel-amazon --time_window -1y
```

This single, parameterized script now handles your data preprocessing cleanly. The output will be saved in `data/2_intermediate/rel-amazon/expanded_train.csv`. This is the first major step in converting your notebook into a modular project.

Our next step will be to create the `src/features/build_graph.py` script to consume this intermediate file. Would you like to proceed with that?
