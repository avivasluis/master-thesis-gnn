**User**

OK I am working in my master thesis where I am conducting a research on the applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and relational databases, focusing on identifying optimal methods to represent relational data as graphs for subsequent processing with deep learning algorithms.

Right now my question is more about what things shoild I consider about organizing my code and my project?? Like rigth now I have many folders with different purposes but I feel is disorganized and I dont know if there are like some 'good practices' that would be helpful to organize the folders and the files of my code...

Addittionally, I am working mostly with jupyter notebooks and i dont know if that is a good idea? is it better to work with scripts (.py files ?) is it better in terms of efficiency, does it looks more professional? I dont know, and if its like this, which thing should I consider to create my scrips? which is the best way to organize my the code using scrips??

Of course! It's great that you're thinking about project organization early on. Structuring your project well from the beginning will save you a lot of time and headaches later, especially for a Master's thesis which involves a lot of experimentation and iteration. Let's break down your questions.

### 1. Project and Code Organization

Your feeling of disorganization is very common. Research projects often start with a collection of scripts, notebooks, and data folders. Adopting a standardized structure makes your work more reproducible, easier to navigate for yourself and others (like your thesis advisor!), and simpler to manage.

Here is a widely-used and effective project structure for data science and machine learning projects. You can adapt it to your specific needs.

```
your-thesis-project/
├── data/
│   ├── 01_raw/          # Original, immutable data.
│   ├── 02_intermediate/ # Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   └── 03_processed/    # The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│
├── models/              # Trained and serialized models, model predictions, etc.
│
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks. Name them to reflect their purpose.
│   ├── 01-initial-data-exploration.ipynb
│   ├── 02-modeling-approach-1.ipynb
│   └── 03-visualize-results.ipynb
│
├── src/                 # Source code for your project.
│   ├── __init__.py      # Makes src a Python package.
│   ├── data/            # Scripts to download or generate data.
│   │   └── make_dataset.py
│   ├── features/        # Scripts to turn raw data into features.
│   │   └── build_features.py
│   ├── models/          # Scripts to train models and/or make predictions.
│   │   ├── train_model.py
│   │   └── predict_model.py
│   └── visualization/   # Scripts to create visualizations.
│       └── visualize.py
│
├── reports/             # Generated analysis, figures for your thesis, etc.
│   └── figures/         # Generated graphics and figures.
│
├── environment.yml      # For Conda environment.
├── requirements.txt     # For pip environment (pip freeze > requirements.txt).
└── README.md            # A high-level overview of the project.
```

**How to adapt your current folders:**

*   **`amazon_rel/`**: This looks like a dataset. It would probably go into `data/01_raw/`.
*   **`Relbench_Tutorials/`, `Polars_tutorial/`, `vs_code_test_notebook/`**: These seem like exploratory work. You could keep them in a separate `tutorials/` folder, or clean up the useful notebooks and move them to `notebooks/` with descriptive names.
*   **`I2R/`, `useful_code/`**: These likely contain reusable code. This is perfect material to refactor into Python scripts (`.py` files) inside the `src/` directory. For example, a helper function could go into a `src/utils.py` file.
*   **`Codigo_Autoencoder.txt`**: This should be a Python file, not a `.txt` file. Based on the name, it could become `src/models/autoencoder.py` or a notebook like `notebooks/04-autoencoder-experiment.ipynb`.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks vs. Python Scripts (.py)

This is a classic question. The best answer for research is **use both, for what they are good at.** It's not about one being better than the other, but about using the right tool for the job.

**Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):**

*   **Strengths:** Excellent for exploration, experimentation, and visualization. The ability to mix code, text, equations, and plots makes them perfect for developing ideas and sharing results in a narrative format. They are your digital lab notebook.
*   **Weaknesses:** They can become messy if you run cells out of order. They are difficult to version control with `git` because they are stored as JSON files. They don't encourage writing reusable, modular code.

**Python Scripts (.py):**

*   **Strengths:** The standard for building robust, reusable, and modular code. They are easy to version control, test, and can be run from the command line, which is essential for automating experiments. This is considered more "professional" for the core logic of a project.
*   **Weaknesses:** The feedback loop is slower. You have to run the whole script to see an output or a plot, which makes them less ideal for interactive data exploration.

**The Hybrid Workflow (Recommended):**

This approach gives you the best of both worlds and is very common in professional data science and research settings.

1.  **Explore in Notebooks:** Do your initial data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization in a Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
2.  **Prototype a Model:** Build your first version of a model and training loop inside the notebook to quickly see if your idea works.
3.  **Refactor to Scripts:** Once you have a piece of code that is stable and you'll likely reuse it (e.g., a data preprocessing function, the GNN model class, a training function), move it into a `.py` file in the `src/` directory.
4.  **Import Your Code:** In your notebook, you can now import your own code.

Here's a simple example:

Your notebook `notebooks/02-gnn-experiment.ipynb` might look like this:

```python
# In your notebook
import sys
sys.path.append('../src') # Allows importing from the src folder

from data.make_dataset import load_graph_data
from models.train_model import train_gnn

# 1. Load data
data = load_graph_data('../data/01_raw/amazon_rel/')

# 2. Train model with specific parameters for this experiment
hyperparameters = {'lr': 0.01, 'epochs': 100}
model, history = train_gnn(data, params=hyperparameters)

# 3. Analyze results in the notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(history['loss'])
```

This keeps your notebook clean and focused on the experiment, while the complex logic is neatly organized in your `src/` folder.

### 3. Best Practices for Writing Scripts

When you move code to `.py` files, here are some things to keep in mind:

*   **Modularity:** Break your code into logical files. For example:
    *   `src/data/make_dataset.py`: Functions for loading and preparing your graph data.
    *   `src/models/gnn.py`: The actual GNN model definition (e.g., a PyTorch `nn.Module` class).
    *   `src/models/train_model.py`: Your main training loop, validation logic, and model saving.
*   **Use Functions and Classes:** Avoid having a long script that just runs from top to bottom. Wrap your logic in functions and classes.
*   **Configuration:** Don't hardcode parameters like file paths, learning rates, or model sizes. A great way to manage this is with command-line arguments using Python's `argparse` module.

Here is an example of a simple `train_model.py`:

```python:src/models/train_model.py
import argparse

def train(data_path, epochs, learning_rate):
    """Main training logic goes here."""
    print(f"Loading data from: {data_path}")
    print(f"Training for {epochs} epochs with learning rate {learning_rate}")
    # ... your actual training code ...
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # This allows you to run the script from the command line
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Train a GNN model.")
    
    parser.add_argument('--data_path', type=str, required=True, help='Path to the processed data.')
    parser.add_argument('--epochs', type=int, default=50, help='Number of training epochs.')
    parser.add_argument('--lr', type=float, default=0.001, help='Learning rate.')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    train(data_path=args.data_path, epochs=args.epochs, learning_rate=args.lr)

```

You could then run this from your terminal, making it easy to launch multiple experiments:
`python src/models/train_model.py --data_path data/03_processed/my_graph.pt --epochs 100 --lr 0.01`

*   **Environment Management:** Use a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`) to manage your project's dependencies. Keep track of them in a `requirements.txt` (for pip) or `environment.yml` (for conda) file. This is crucial for reproducibility.

Starting with these practices will make your research process much smoother. Good luck with your thesis!

**User**

ok I have another doubt in my mind... I dont have a laptop with GPU to train the models... For me, it would be ideal to leverage platforms like Kaggle where I have a fair amount of GPU usage for free to do my experiments (that are small/moderate in size)...

Is there any way to work in Kaggle using the code organization you have mentioned? like different scripts with modular design for different purposes? 

---

**Cursor**

Excellent question. This is a very common challenge for students and researchers who need more computational power than their laptops can provide. The answer is **yes, you absolutely can use that professional, modular code organization on platforms like Kaggle or Google Colab.**

Doing so is a fantastic practice. It keeps your Kaggle notebooks clean, readable, and focused on the experiment, while your core logic remains organized, reusable, and version-controlled.

The standard way to achieve this on Kaggle is by packaging your source code (`src` directory) and uploading it as a private **Kaggle Dataset**. Here’s a step-by-step guide to this workflow.

### The Workflow: Code as a Dataset

The core idea is to treat your own `.py` scripts as just another input to your main notebook, alongside your actual data.

#### Step 1: Organize Your Code Locally

First, arrange your reusable code in the `src` directory as we discussed. For example:

```
your-thesis-project/
├── notebooks/
│   └── experimental-notebook.ipynb
└── src/
    ├── __init__.py               # Important! Makes 'src' a package.
    ├── data_utils.py             # Functions to load/process data.
    ├── models.py                 # Your GNN model class definitions.
    └── training.py               # Your training loop function.
```

Let's imagine your files have some content:

**`src/models.py`**
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleGNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features):
        super(SimpleGNN, self).__init__()
        # ... your model layers
        self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        # ... your forward pass logic
        return self.linear(x)
```

**`src/training.py`**
```python
import torch

def train_one_epoch(model, data, optimizer):
    # ... your training loop logic for one epoch
    print("Training for one epoch...")
    loss = torch.tensor(0.5) # Dummy loss
    return loss
```

#### Step 2: Upload Your `src` Folder to Kaggle Datasets

1.  Go to Kaggle and navigate to the **"Datasets"** section.
2.  Click on **"New Dataset"**.
3.  Give it a title, for example, `my-thesis-gnn-code`.
4.  Drag and drop your entire `src` folder into the upload area. Kaggle will preserve the folder structure.
5.  Make sure to set the dataset to **private** so only you can see and use it.
6.  Click **"Create"**. Kaggle will process it. You now have a versioned dataset of your source code!

![Kaggle New Dataset](https://i.imgur.com/uS0J7b7.png)

#### Step 3: Use Your Code in a Kaggle Notebook

1.  Create a new Kaggle notebook or open an existing one.
2.  In the right-hand panel, click **"+ Add data"**.
3.  Go to the **"Your Datasets"** tab, find your newly created code dataset (`my-thesis-gnn-code`), and add it.
4.  Kaggle will mount this dataset at the path `/kaggle/input/my-thesis-gnn-code/`. Your code will be inside, at `/kaggle/input/my-thesis-gnn-code/src/`.

5.  **This is the key step.** In the first cell of your notebook, you need to tell Python where to find your modules. You do this by adding your code's directory to the system path.

```python
import sys

# This is the path to the folder containing your 'src' directory
CODE_DIR = '/kaggle/input/my-thesis-gnn-code/'

# Append the directory to the system path
sys.path.append(CODE_DIR)
```

6.  Now you can import your functions and classes as if they were a regular Python library!

```python
# Now you can import directly from your .py files
from src.models import SimpleGNN
from src.training import train_one_epoch
# You can also do 'import src.models'

print("Successfully imported custom modules!")

# --- Your experiment starts here ---

# 1. Initialize your model from your script
model = SimpleGNN(in_features=16, out_features=2)
print("Model created:", model)

# 2. Use your training function from your script
# (Assuming you've loaded data and set up an optimizer)
# loss = train_one_epoch(model, data, optimizer)
# print(f"Dummy loss: {loss}")
```

### Advantages of This Approach

*   **Clean and Readable Notebooks:** Your notebooks are now high-level scripts that orchestrate experiments. They are not cluttered with hundreds of lines of class and function definitions.
*   **Reusability:** You can attach the same code dataset to dozens of different experimental notebooks without copying and pasting.
*   **Version Control:** This is a huge benefit for research. If you find a bug in your model or want to add a new feature:
    1.  Fix it locally in your `src` directory.
    2.  Go to your Kaggle dataset page and upload a new version.
    3.  Kaggle versions the dataset. You can now go back to an old notebook, attach the *old version* of your code, and reproduce your results perfectly.
*   **Single Source of Truth:** Your core logic lives in one place, not scattered and duplicated across multiple messy notebooks.

This workflow beautifully combines the modularity and robustness of classic software development with the interactive and experimental nature of platforms like Kaggle. It's the ideal way to structure a serious research project in that environment.
